To create a self-signed certificate for code-signing purposes using PowerShell's New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet, you can follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator
Open PowerShell with administrator privileges because creating certificates typically requires administrative access.

#### Step 2: Run the Command
Use the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet to generate the certificate. Here's an example command:

TEMPLATE: 
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=YourCompanyName" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -FriendlyName "YourCodeSigningCertName"
```

ACTUAL COMMAND:
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type CodeSigningCert -Subject "CN=Xureilab" -KeyUsage DigitalSignature -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -FriendlyName "ShadertasticCert"
```

Explanation of Parameters:
- **Type CodeSigningCert**: Specifies the type of certificate to create, in this case, a code signing certificate.
- **Subject "CN=YourCompanyName"**: Defines the subject name for the certificate. Replace "YourCompanyName" 
  with your actual company name or any name you prefer.
- **KeyUsage DigitalSignature**: Specifies that the key can be used for digital signatures.
- **CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"**: Sets the location to store the certificate. 
  This example stores it in the Current User's personal certificate store.
- **FriendlyName "YourCodeSigningCertName"**: Assigns a friendly name to the certificate for easier identification.
  Replace "YourCodeSigningCertName" with your desired name.

#### Step 3: Export the Certificate (Optional)
You might want to export the certificate for use on other machines or to share it.
Use the following command to export it to a .pfx file:

```powershell
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert "Cert:\CurrentUser\My\CertificateThumbprint" -FilePath "C:\path\to\exported\certificate.pfx" -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YourPassword" -Force -AsPlainText)
```

Replace "CertificateThumbprint" with the actual thumbprint of your certificate 
(you can get this from the output of the New-SelfSignedCertificate command).  
Also, replace "YourPassword" with your desired password for the exported .pfx file. 
**DO NOT** reuse a password from anywhere else. Use a password manager, don't be stupid.

#### Step 4 : Encode the pfx with certutil
(This has not been generated by ChatGPT)
```powershell
certutil -encode C:\path\to\exported\certificate.pfx C:\path\to\exported\certificate.txt
```

#### Step 5 : Add the encoded certificate in the Github actions secret
In the repository settings > secrets and variables > Actions.  

Add a repository secret named `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` with the content of `certificate.txt`.  
Add anothe repository secret named `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASS` with the password you used to generate it.

#### Important Notes:
Remember to keep your private key secure and avoid sharing it.  
Self-signed certificates might not be as trusted as those issued by a certificate authority (CA), especially in production environments.   
Users might receive warnings when using software signed with a self-signed certificate.  
This process generates a self-signed code signing certificate that you can use to sign DLLs or other software components.
